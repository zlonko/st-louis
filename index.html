                <h3><strong><a href="https://www.tims.page">Tim Zielonko</a></strong> | October 24, 2020</h3>
                <p>
                In 1877, St. Louis, Missouri separated into two distinct governments: the City and the County. 
                In the time since, the County exploded in size, while the City shrank to nearly a third of 
                its peak population. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Although the chart on the right illustrates this dramatic history, it leaves out important details about 
                the people living in the City and the County. This is especially true for differences in race and income.

                <h2>How many people live in St. Louis?</h2>
                <p>
                Let's start by elaborating on how many people live in the City and the County. Each bubble represents a 
                tract, which is a standard unit of measurement used by the U.S. Census. The size of a bubble represents the 
                total population of that tract.
                </p>
                <p>
                As shown in the previous chart, the County has more than 
                <span class="highlighter">three times the number of residents</span>
                than the City. Hover over a census tract to learn more about the people who live there.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>How much do residents make?</h2>
                <p>
                With this in mind, let's use a histogram to arrange our census tracts by median income. 
                Notice how blue bubbles are located further left than pink bubbles. 
                <span class="highlighter">Median income tends to be higher in the County</span> than in the City.
                </p>
                <p>
                Let's review what we've seen so far. The City is less populous than the County following more than a century 
                of residents moving away. Also, City residents tend to make less money than County residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                So, what do we know about the residents themselves?
                </p>
                <svg id='categorylegenda' width='400px' height='200px'></svg>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>Who lives in St. Louis?</h2>
                <p>
                To answer this question, let's return to our first chart and make one adjustment. The size of each bubble still 
                represents the number of residents in a census tract, but 
                <span class="highlighter">color now represents the racial diversity</span> 
                of those residents. Approximately 30% of all Americans are people of color, so blue bubbles signify census tracts 
                that meet or exceed that national average.
                </p>
                <p>
                When we count all of the people of color in the St. Louis region, we learn that they make up a higher proportion of 
                City residents (53%) than County residents (31%). While the City has fewer residents than the County, City residents 
                are more racially diverse than those in the County.
                </p>
                <svg id='categorylegend2' width='400px' height='200px'></svg>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>What about Black St. Louisians?</h2>
                <p>
                This difference is more pronounced when we compare Black communities. In fact,
                <span class="highlighter">Black residents make up almost half of the City population</span> (46%), 
                while they are roughly a quarter of the County population (24%).
                </p>
                <p>
                Again, we set the threshold to the national average. Therefore, blue bubbles indicate census tracts where at 
                least 13% of residents identify as Black.
                </p>

            </section>
            
            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>Do race and income interact?</h2>
                <p>
                We've learned that median income is higher in the County and the City is more racially diverse, especially when it comes to the proportion 
                of Black residents. Using the same national threshold (13%), let's examine the relationship between the proportion of 
                Black residents <i>x</i> and median income <i>y</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                Across St. Louis, 
                <span class="highlighter">income decreases as the proportion of Black residents increases</span>. 
                Also, notice the census tracts clustered on the ends of this distribution. This further expresses a racial division in wealth.
                </p>
                <svg id='categorylegend4' width='400px' height='200px'></svg>

            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>What about poverty?</h2>
                <p>
                Finally, we can visualize the relationship between the proportion of residents at or below the national poverty threshold 
                and the proportion of Black residents in a census tract. 
                </p>
                <p>
                As we may expect from our observations of median income, areas of St. Louis with a higher proportion of Black residents 
                also tend to have a 
                <span class="highlighter">higher proportion of residents living in poverty</span>.

                <p>
                We've only scratched the surface of this complex issue, but hopefully this overview has caught your interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                As you read this, initiatives are underway to repair racial disparities in the City and County. Policy reform, business incentives,
                and community programs are just a few of the important steps being taken towards a more equitable St. Louis.
